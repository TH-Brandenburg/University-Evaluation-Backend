# University Evaluation Backend 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TH-Brandenburg/University-Evaluation-Backend.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/TH-Brandenburg/University-Evaluation-Backend)

This project presents a software solution of the evaluation
problem faced by universities. The software consists of a REST-server (Github: CampusAppEvalBackend) application and to date this Android client project. The software
features automated processing of given answers, independency
of location, a flexible data model supporting multiple questionnaires
and an interface designed to be used effectively upon first
encounter. While our approach aims to support a high participation
rate of the evaluations it is currently tested in a live environment
to see if it reaches this goal.
